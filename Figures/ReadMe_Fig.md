# Figures

This file is for rendered graphs and visualizations that are *not* stored in text. Generally speaking, these are best stored as .png with a transparent background (requires alpha channel).

If you are trying to render out any images, I recommend something smaller than 1200x1200. If you want something high quality, .svg or .tiff is your friend.
